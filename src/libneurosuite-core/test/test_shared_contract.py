test_shared_contract.py — the cross-repo shared files must be byte-identical.

custody_vectors.tsv and pca_method_vectors.tsv are shipped in BOTH neurosuite-3
and fiber-kit on purpose: they are one table run by every language mirror, so the
implementations cannot drift apart.  That only holds while the two copies are the
same file.  PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS says to "verify with md5sum", which is a habit,
and habits are exactly what this table exists to replace -- the token parsers had
a documented convention too, and drifted anyway.

So: a test.  It hashes this repo's copies and compares against the hashes
recorded below, which are the values both repos carry.  Changing a vector file is
then a two-repo change by construction: update the table, update the hash here,
and the same in the other repo, or this fails.

If the other checkout is available, point at it and the comparison is direct
rather than against a recorded hash:

    FK_ROOT=/path/to/neurosuite-3 python3 test/test_shared_contract.py
